## Jumana Care
Community-driven, compassionate maternal care made for you.

## Overview
Jumana Care is a community-based app for Black mothers in Georgia to be matched with certified doulas, join group prenatal sessions, document their feelings throughout their pregnancy, and find social resources like childcare and transportation. 

To bridge communication gaps between clinicians and expectant individuals, the app integrates with electronic health records, offering providers vital patient insights like their health literacy level. 

Jumana Care helps women have safer pregnancies and feel empowered.
